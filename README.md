## Gotchas

- MDX Frontmatter consistency
  > Given _Foo.mdx_ with `- next: bar`, _Bar.mdx_ needs `- pre: foo`.

- Clearing persisted Tabs
  > Try changing its config (in MDX) and refreshing.
  > Otherwise a React hook will write it on page close.

- Changing the geomorph JSON data structure and not migrating all geomorphs can produce hard-to-debug errors.
  > Some of the `useGeomorph`s go into idle state, and don't throw an error (why?).
