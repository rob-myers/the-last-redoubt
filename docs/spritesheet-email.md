Hi, 

First some background:

- I'm working on a website about programming NPCs. See https://staging.lastredoubt.co/test/#test-tabs.

- For background graphics I am using certain non-commercial-use assets based on Traveller RPG. See:
  - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)
  - http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2020/07/starship-geomorphs-20.html?m=1
  - https://www.worldanvil.com/w/traveller3A-eden-gamemonstergr/c/playable-races-category

- But I need characters, preferably races from the Traveller universe.
  So far I've made a walking animation based on another I saw online:

Ok, that's the background.
I would like you to make some spritesheets for a Hlanssai (please see races link above)

1. A walk animation (preferably ≥ 10 frames).
2. An idle standing animation (preferably ≥ 10 frames).
3. Individual poses: sit, stand (maybe covered by idle), lie, lean (against wall).

I am potentially interested in many more animations, depending on whether they fit the style I am going for. If I use them, I will certainly give you explicit credit on the website (plus any links you want).

Have I provided enough detail?

Cheers,
Rob Myers
