  - handle hull doors (two doors)

- 🚧 Retarget:
  - ✅ `The Last Redoubt` -> `NPC CLI`
  - 🚧 Adjust Home Page
    - ❌ GIF demo of CLI
    - ✅ Video demo of CLI
      > `ffmpeg -i 'Screen Recording 2022-11-06 at 17.00.40.mov' -an -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=20,scale=600:-1" -b:v 0 -crf 25 output.mp4`
    - Redo video demo of CLI with sound
    - Adjust textual copy, emphasising _canonical_ UIs:
      - POSIX CLI
      - Browser devtool  
    - 🚧 Video demo of `World` CSS/DOM
  - Adjust Intro

- 🚧 Remake homepage CLI video with sound
  - ✅ 1st test
    > `ffmpeg -i 'Screen Recording 2022-11-19 at 14.16.37.mov' -ac 2 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=20:-1" -b:v 0 -crf 25 cli-frontpage-test.mp4`
    > 329Mb -> 20Mb
    > https://youtu.be/iohh0Glruis

- Make homepage CSS video 

- 🚧 Performance
  - ✅ Remove YouTube from SSR via facade
  - ✅ Try upgrading Gatsby
  - 🚧 Smaller main bundle
  - remark/rehypePlugins ?

- ✅ anim.sprites also has initial delay to preserve sprite duration modification
- Safari: Door collision bug
  - ✅ Should not start animation before initial cancel
  - ✅ Cancel track on collide door should not be jerky
- Safari: Jerky zoom issues
  - incorrect screen clipping?
  - e.g. zoom out then click walk

- 🚧 NPC idle can be sitting or standing

  - ✅ decor point callback can log to terminal
  - ✅ shell func `roomUi` add/removes ui points in player's current room
  - ✅ `roomUi` -> `localDecor` wraps NPCs toggleLocalDecor
  - ✅ `localDecor` shows initially and hides on termination
  - when `idle` can change to `sit`

- Prefer _moving circle_ vs _static angled rect_
  - decor seg -> rect
  - Abandon _moving seg_ vs _static seg_ collision prediction
    - ✅ Hide in debug mode
    - Remove related code
  - Start mdx description of algorithm

- Follow cam should trigger on "resize" tab

    - ✅ segment via styled div (NEW)
    - ✅ path ~ div nodes with auto-redrawn path? 
    - ✅ circle/seg also mutate decor onchange via devtool
    - ✅ `npc decor foo` gets decor foo
    - ✅ support e.g.
      - `{ echo foo; echo bar; } | npc rm-decor`
      - `{ echo foo; echo bar; } | npc decor`
  - can add test seg e.g.
    > `npc decor '{ key: "bar", type: "seg", src: {"x":207.83,"y":384.43}, dst: {"x":227.83,"y":384.43} }'`
  - 🚧 translate textual algorithm into `predictNpcSegCollision`
  - test against manually placed segs
  - integrate into NPC vs Door collision prevention

- Recall how NPC vs Door intersection is currently computed
  - getNpcsIntersecting > circleIntersectsConvexPolygon
  - playerNearDoor > circleIntersectsConvexPolygon
  - ...
- ...
- Collision issue when initially start very close
  > e.g. just after collided

  - Tabs now uses `visibility: hidden` instead of `display: none`
- ✅ BUG bridge window lighting
  - frosted windows should not contribute to light shade
- ✅ Center page when nav menu open and ≥ 1450px (?)
- ✅ BUG /test gm302 open door

## Screen captures

✅ Convert a screen recording to MP4 or GIF

- ```sh
  # Convert mov to mp4
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -qscale 0 output.mp4
  # Convert mov to gif
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -qscale 0 output.gif
  ```
- file:///Users/robmyers/coding/the-last-redoubt/public/output.gif

✅ Smaller + Faster GIF

- https://www.baeldung.com/linux/convert-videos-gifs-ffmpeg#creating-a-custom-palette
- ```sh
  # 20 seconds (orig 19s), output 4.3mb
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=720:-1" output.gif
  # 1.3Mb
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=400:-1" output.gif
  # 1.1Mb
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=300:-1" output.gif
  ```
- file:///Users/robmyers/coding/the-last-redoubt/public/output.gif

- too large

- ❌ CSS GIF pause-reset/play https://css-tricks.com/pause-gif-details-summary/

✅ Try MP4 and WebM

```sh
# 210kb
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=400:-1" output.mp4
# 300kb
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=400:-1" output.webm
```

  - ✅ cancel pending pastes
  - ✅ cleanup session xterm
    - ✅ cancel ongoing commands
    - ✅ unlink tty

- ✅ Disable/Enable Tabs should not make idle npc walk again

  - ISSUE with getter inside `useStateRef` i.e. `state` was undefined
- ✅ `spawn` should not finish until npc mounted and NPCS.npc[key] exists

- ✅ `spawn foo $( click 1 )` should not trigger a walk
  - seems `goLoop` is receiving click before npc has moved, so plans a walk
  - we force click to be ignored by earlier handlers

- ✅ fix stateroom 100 (as seen in gm 303)

- ✅ stop npc from walking through doors
  ```sh
  nav foo $( click 1 ) | walk foo
  ```
- ✅ rethink light through nearby doors
- ✅ Weird animation pause on disable Tabs
- ✅ Change Tabs splitter size on mobile
  ```tsx
  (jsonModel.global = jsonModel.global || {}).splitterSize = 16;
  (jsonModel.global = jsonModel.global || {}).splitterExtra = 12;
  ```
