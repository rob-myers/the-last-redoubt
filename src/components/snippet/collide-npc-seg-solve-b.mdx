Dividing by it and substituting $\lambda_i = ...$ into (2) yields:
- $a t + b \lambda + c = 0$.
- $a := u \delta_y - u \delta_x / \tau_{ix}$
- $b := \tau_x / \tau_{ix} -\tau_y$
- $c := (\alpha_x - \alpha_{ix}) / \tau_{ix} + (\alpha_{iy} - \alpha_y)$

We split into cases:
- If $a \neq 0$ and $b = 0$ we may test $-c / a \in [0, t_\Omega]$.<QedIcon/>
- If $a = 0$ and $b \neq 0$ then we know $\lambda =  -c / b$.
  Moreover $a = 0$ implies $\delta_x = \tau_{ix} \delta_y$, so that both $\delta_x$ and $\delta_y$ are non-zero (because they cannot both be). Then (1) yields:
  > $t = -\frac{\tau_{ix}}{u \delta_x} \lambda_i + \frac{1}{u\delta_x} (\alpha_x - \alpha_{ix} - \tau_x c/b)$.
- If $a = b = 0$ then observe:
  > $\frac{1}{\tau_{ix}} = \delta_y / \delta_x = \tau_y / \tau_x = (\alpha_{iy} - \alpha_y) / (\alpha_{ix} - \alpha_x)$

  because $a = 0$, $b = 0$ and necessarily $c = 0$ (respectively).
  Then the NPC's direction is aligned to the fixed line segment.
  The vector difference of the start of the two line segments is also so aligned.
  Then they may only collide via a glancing collision (coincidence) so we may assume they do not collide.<QedIcon/>
- Finally if they are both non-zero we obtain:
  > $t = -\frac{b}{a} \lambda - \frac{c}{a}$.
