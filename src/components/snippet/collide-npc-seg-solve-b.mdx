Dividing (1) by it and substituting $\lambda_i = ...$ into (2) yields:
- $a t + b \lambda + c = 0$.
- $a := u \delta_y - u \delta_x (\tau_{iy} / \tau_{ix})$
- $b := \tau_x (\tau_{iy} / \tau_{ix}) - \tau_y$
- $c := (\alpha_x - \alpha_{ix}) (\tau_{iy} / \tau_{ix}) + (\alpha_{iy} - \alpha_y)$

<!-- ISSUES? Careful about division by potentially zero param -->

We split into cases:
- If $a \neq 0$ and $b = 0$ we may test $-c / a \in [0, t_\Omega]$.<QedIcon/>
- If $a = 0$ and $b \neq 0$ then we know $\lambda =  -c / b$.
  Moreover $a = 0$ implies $\delta_x = (\tau_{ix} / \tau_{iy}) \delta_y$, so that both $\delta_x$ and $\delta_y$ are non-zero (because they cannot both be).
  <!-- ðŸš§ extra case here (?) if tau_{iy} = 0 know delta_y = 0 but ...  -->
  Then (1) yields:
  > $t = -\frac{\tau_{ix}}{u \delta_x} \lambda_i + \frac{1}{u\delta_x} (\alpha_x - \alpha_{ix} - \tau_x c/b)$.
- If $a = b = 0$ then observe:
  > $\frac{\tau_{iy}}{\tau_{ix}} = \delta_y / \delta_x = \tau_y / \tau_x = (\alpha_{iy} - \alpha_y) / (\alpha_{ix} - \alpha_x)$

  because $a = 0$, $b = 0$ and thus $c = 0$ too.
  Division by $\tau_{ix}$ is well-defined by assumption.
  Division by $\delta_x$ is well-defined else $\delta_x = \delta_y = 0$ (a contradiction).
  Division by $\tau_x$ is well-defined else $\tau_x = \tau_y = 0$ (a contradiction).
  However, the final division may not be defined i.e. $\alpha_{ix} - \alpha_x = 0$, in which case $\alpha_{iy} - \alpha_y = 0$.

  Then the NPC's direction is aligned to the fixed line segment,
  and the vector difference of the start of the line segments:
  (i) has the same direction, or
  (ii) is zero.
  Then they may only collide via a glancing collision (coincidence or at a point) so we may assume they do not collide.<QedIcon/>
- Finally if they are both non-zero we obtain:
  > $t = -\frac{b}{a} \lambda - \frac{c}{a}$.
