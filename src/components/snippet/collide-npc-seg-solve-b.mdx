Dividing (1) by it and substituting $\lambda_i = ...$ into (2) yields:
- $a t + b \lambda + c = 0$.
- $a := u \delta_y - u \delta_x (\tau_{iy} / \tau_{ix})$
- $b := \tau_x (\tau_{iy} / \tau_{ix}) - \tau_y$
- $c := (\alpha_x - \alpha_{ix}) (\tau_{iy} / \tau_{ix}) + (\alpha_{iy} - \alpha_y)$

<!-- ISSUES? Careful about division by potentially zero param -->

We split into cases:
- If $a \neq 0$ and $b = 0$ we may test $-c / a \in [0, t_\Omega]$.<QedIcon/>
- If $a = 0$ and $b \neq 0$ then we know $\lambda =  -c / b$.
  Moreover $a = 0$ implies $\delta_x = (\tau_{ix} / \tau_{iy}) \delta_y$, so that both $\delta_x$ and $\delta_y$ are non-zero (because they cannot both be).
  <!-- ðŸš§ extra case here (?) if tau_{iy} = 0 know delta_y = 0 but ...  -->
  Then (1) yields:
  > $t = -\frac{\tau_{ix}}{u \delta_x} \lambda_i + \frac{1}{u\delta_x} (\alpha_x - \alpha_{ix} - \tau_x c/b)$.
- If $a = b = 0$ then observe:
  > $\frac{\tau_{iy}}{\tau_{ix}} = \delta_y / \delta_x = \tau_y / \tau_x = (\alpha_{iy} - \alpha_y) / (\alpha_{ix} - \alpha_x)$
  <!-- ðŸš§ extra reasoning to explain why can divide by these params i.e. non-zero else contradiction -->

  because $a = 0$, $b = 0$ and necessarily $c = 0$ (respectively).
  Then the NPC's direction is aligned to the fixed line segment.
  The vector difference of the start of the two line segments is also so aligned.
  Then they may only collide via a glancing collision (coincidence) so we may assume they do not collide.<QedIcon/>
- Finally if they are both non-zero we obtain:
  > $t = -\frac{b}{a} \lambda - \frac{c}{a}$.
