### Collision Prediction: NPC vs Angled Rect

{/* Rectangle needn't be axis-aligned. */}

View an NPC as a circle moving at constant speed between two points.
Suppose there is a static rectangle which needn't be axis-aligned (it may be rotated).

> Does the NPC intersect the rectangle before it reaches its target?

We actually answer an easier question.
That is, we view the circle as a square with axes aligned to the rectangle's.
