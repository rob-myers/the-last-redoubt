### Collision Prediction: NPC vs NPC

Take two distinct NPCs $A$ and $B$.
Model them as circles moving at constant speed towards particular points.
We permit an NPC to be stationary.
> _Do the NPC's intersect before they reach their target?_
> - Assume A is moving. <SideNote>If $A$ and $B$ are both static, test the distance between the circle centers.</SideNote>
> - Let $s_A$ (resp. $s_B$) be the speed of $A$ (resp. of $B$).
> - Let $r_A$ (resp. $r_B$) be the radius of the NPCs.
> - Let $dist_{\rm min}$ be the minimum distance allowed between NPC $A$ and $B$,
    e.g. $r_A + r_B - 0.1$.
