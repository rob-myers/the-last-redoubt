#### Case: Both A and B are moving

If the axis-aligned rectangles
$\tt npcA.getWalkSegBounds()$ and $\tt npcB.getWalkSegBounds()$
don't intersect, the NPCs won't collide.<QedIcon/>


Otherwise for $\nu \in \{ A, B \}$ we have time-varying positions:
- $p_\nu(t) := src_\nu + t . s_\nu . tangent_\nu$
- $src_\nu := {\tt npc\nu.getPosition()}$
- $dst_\nu := {\tt npc\nu.getTarget()}$
- $tangent_\nu := \widehat{dst_\nu - src_\nu}$

We restrict to times $0 \leq t \leq t_\Omega := min(\frac{dst_A - src_A}{s_A}, \frac{dst_B - src_B}{s_B})$.
That is, we only check for collisions whilst both NPCs are moving.
The remaining time could be handled via [the previous case](#case--a-moves-but-b-is-stationary),
but we prefer to handle it elsewhere.

> Then to predict a collision,
> we seek the minimal $t \in [0, t_\Omega]$ such that $|p_A(t) - p_B(t)|^2 \leq dist_{\rm min}^2$.

recalling $dist_{\rm min}$ from the previous section.
This can be rearranged into a quadratic inequality:

- $a.t^2 + b.t + c â‰¤ 0$
- $a := s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 . s_A . s_B . (tangent_A \cdot tangent_B)$
- $b := 2. (s_A . dp_A - s_B . dp_B)$
- $c := |p_B(0) - p_A(0)|^2 - dist_{\rm min}^2$

where $dp_\nu := tangent_\nu \cdot (src_A - src_B)$ for $\nu \in \{ A, B \}$.
Then:
- If $dp_A >= 0$ then $A$ is not moving towards $B$, so the NPC's don't collide.<QedIcon/> <SideNote>Technically they may be colliding, but we allow them to separate.</SideNote>
- If $dp_B <= 0$ then $B$ is not moving towards $A$, so the NPC's don't collide.<QedIcon/>
- If $c \leq 0$ the NPCs collide at $t = 0$.<QedIcon/>

Otherwise we seek minimal $0 < t \leq t_\Omega$ such that $a.t^2 + b.t + c = 0$.
Any solutions take the form:
$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{x}}{2a}
\qquad
\text{where $x := b^2 - 4.a.c$}.
$$
- If $x < 0$ there are no solutions, and the NPCs don't collide.<QedIcon/>
- If $x = 0$ there is exactly one solution. It is a "glancing collision",
  so we may assume they do not collide.<QedIcon/>
- If $x > 0$ there are two solutions.
  Now $a \geq 0$ always holds <SideNote>The lower bound $s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2. s_A . s_B = (s_A - s_B)^2$ is non-negative.</SideNote> and by assumption $c > 0$, hence $0 < x \leq b^2$.
  By assumption $dp_A < 0$ and $dp_B > 0$ hence $-b > 0$.
  Then $-b - \sqrt{x} > 0$, 
  so _both_ real-valued solutions are positive and $t_0 := (-b - \sqrt{x}) . \frac{1}{a}$ is the smaller one.
  If $0 < t_0 \leq t_\Omega$ then the NPCs collide, otherwise they don't.<QedIcon/> <SideNote>Technically they do not collide whilst both NPCs are moving (see above).</SideNote>
