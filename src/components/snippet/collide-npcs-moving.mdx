#### Case: Both A and B are moving

If the axis-aligned rectangles
$\tt npcA.getWalkSegBounds()$ and $\tt npcB.getWalkSegBounds()$
don't intersect, the NPCs won't collide.<QedIcon/>


Otherwise for $\nu \in \{ A, B \}$ we have time-varying positions:
- $p_\nu(t) := src_\nu + t . s_\nu . tangent_\nu$
- $src_\nu := {\tt npc\nu.getPosition()}$
- $dst_\nu := {\tt npc\nu.getTarget()}$
- $tangent_\nu := \widehat{dst_\nu - src_\nu}$

We restrict to times $0 \leq t \leq t_\Omega := min(\frac{dst_A - src_A}{s_A}, \frac{dst_B - src_B}{s_B})$.
That is, we only check for collisions whilst both NPCs are moving.
The remaining time could be handled via [the previous case](#case--a-moves-but-b-is-stationary),
but we prefer to handle it elsewhere.

> Then to predict a collision,
> we seek the minimal $t \in [0, t_\Omega]$ such that $|p_A(t) - p_B(t)|^2 \leq dist_{\rm min}^2$.

recalling $dist_{\rm min}$ from the previous section.
This can be rearranged into a quadratic inequality:

- $a.t^2 + b.t + c â‰¤ 0$
- $a := s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 . s_A . s_B . (tangent_A \cdot tangent_B)$
- $b := 2. (s_A . dp_A - s_B . dp_B)$
- $c := |p_B(0) - p_A(0)|^2 - dist_{\rm min}^2$

where $dp_\nu := tangent_\nu \cdot (src_A - src_B)$ for $\nu \in \{ A, B \}$.
Then:
- If $dp_A >= 0$ then $A$ is not moving towards $B$, so the NPC's don't collide.<QedIcon/> <SideNote>Technically they may be colliding, but we allow them to separate.</SideNote>
- If $dpB <= 0$ then $B$ is not moving towards $A$, so the NPC's don't collide.<QedIcon/>
- If $c \leq 0$ the NPCs collide at $t = 0$.<QedIcon/>

Otherwise, we seek minimal $0 < t \leq t_\Omega$ such that $a.t^2 + b.t + c = 0$.
