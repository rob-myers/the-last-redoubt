### Collision Prediction: NPC vs Line Seg

> _Does an NPC $A$ moving uniformly towards a target
> collide with a line segment?_

Model the NPC as a circle with radius $r$ moving at constant speed $u$.
Let $p_0(t) := a_0 + t . u . \tau_0$ be the position of the NPC at time $t$, where:

- $\tau_0 := \widehat{b_0 - a_0}$ is the direction of the NPC.
- $0 \leq t \leq |b_0 - a_0| / u$.

We may represent the line segment as $p_1(\lambda) := a_1 + \lambda . \tau_1$ where
$τ_1 := \widehat{b_1 - a_1}$ and $0 \leq \lambda \leq |b_1 - a_1|$.
