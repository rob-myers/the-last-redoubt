The NPC has position $p_0(t) := a_0 + t . s . \tau_0$ where:
- $u$ is the NPC's speed.
- $a_0$, $b_0$ is the line segment the NPC traverses.
- $\tau_0 := \widehat{b_0 - a_0}$ is the direction of the NPC.
- $0 \leq t \leq |b_0 - a_0| / u$.

The line segment may be represented as $p_1(\lambda) := a_1 + \lambda . \tau_1$ where:
- $a_1$, $b_1$ are the endpoints.
- $τ_1 := \widehat{b_1 - a_1}$ is a unit vector.
- $0 \leq \lambda \leq |b_1 - a_1|$.

We seek $(t, λ)$ satisfying the above bounds such that:
- $|p_0(t) - p_1(λ)|^2 \leq r^2$ where $r$ is the NPC's radius.
- $t$ is minimal.
