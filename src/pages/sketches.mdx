### Collision Prediction: NPC vs NPC

Take two distinct NPCs A and B modelled as circles moving at constant speed.
- Assume A is moving. <SideNote>If $A$ and $B$ are both static, test the distance between the circles centers.</SideNote>
- Let $s_A$ (resp. $s_B$) be the speed of $A$ (resp. of $B$).
- Let $r_A$ (resp. $r_B$) be the radius of the NPCs.
- Let $dist_{\rm min}$ be the minimum distance allowed between NPC $A$ and $B$.
  > e.g. $r_A + r_B - 0.1$


#### Case A: NPC B is static.

Solving $a.t^2 + b.t + c ≤ 0$,
- $a := s_A^2$
- $b := 2.s_A . dpA$
- $c := distAB^2 - minDist^2$

#### Case C: Both NPCs are moving.

Solving $a.t^2 + b.t + c ≤ 0$,
- $a := s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 . s_A . s_B . \hat{d}_A \cdot \hat{d}_B$
- $b := 2. (s_A . dp_A - s_B . dp_B)$
- $c := |p_B - p_A|^2 - dist_{\rm min}^2$
