## Sketches <RoadWorksIcon />

This site is a mixture of:
- _Engine_: our underlying scriptable Game Engine.
- _Exposition_: writing about Game Dev/AI.
- _Execution_: the Video Game itself.

Initially we need a fair amount of exposition.
This reflects our initial work on the Game Engine before we started creating this site.
Partial exposition is indicated by <RoadWorksIcon />.
This page contains snippets that do not yet have a home.

### Collision Prediction: NPC vs NPC

We model each NPC as a circle with fixed radius moving at a constant speed.
- Let $s_A$ (resp. $s_B$) be the speed of $A$ (resp. of $B$).
- Let $r_A = r_B$ be the radius of NPCs.
- Let $dist_{\rm min}$ be the minimum distance allowed between NPC $A$ and $B$.


#### Case A: Both NPCs are static.

#### Case B: Exactly one NPC is static.

#### Case C: Neither NPC is static.


Solving $a.t^2 + b.t + c â‰¤ 0$,
- $a := s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 . s_A . s_B . \hat{d}_A \cdot \hat{d}_B$
- $b := 2. (s_A . dp_A - s_B . dp_B)$
- $c := |p_B - p_A|^2 - dist_{\rm min}^2$
