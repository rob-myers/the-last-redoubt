## Introduction

### 1. Motivation

What's this website about?

> **Making Game AI** i.e. controlling [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character) in video games.

NPC stands for _Non-Player Character_ - 
every friendly or unfriendly character except for the Player.
Their behaviour shapes the game, steadily drawing the Player into the fabrication.
Then our motivation is **lacklustre NPC behaviour in modern video games**.
Can we clarify the problem?
Can we do better?

Sometimes Game AI is emergent
e.g. Super Mario 3 runs many independent NPC behaviours in parallel.
But freely combining anything much beyond [Koopa Troopas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koopa_Troopa) (fixed patrol route) or [Boo Diddleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_(character)) (approach Player when unseen) usually results in a mess.
The _combinatorial explosion of possibilities_ is hard to debug.

Focusing on the Player's experience is a better idea.
Call everything besides the Player the _environment_.
It is controlled by the _Director_ (a fancy name we've given ourselves and the software agent we're creating).
The Director controls the environment e.g. the NPCs, while the Player has certain freedoms within it.
But the Director needs something to direct,
so we must **create a game** to make meaningful Game AI.

<aside title="parallel-vs-player-xp">

  Technically we could investigate AI without making a game,
  e.g. [demos](https://github.com/RafaelKuebler/Flocking) of Craig Reynolds' [boids](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/).
  But when Game AI is viewed as an interactive protocol between Player and Director,
  objectives are needed to make things meaningful.

### 2. Underlying Tech

We're writing about Game AI and creating a game.
Then it's natural to use web technologies, building the game right here on this site.
But which ones?

> We'll use **everyday web technology** e.g. [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#Functional_components), [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js).
>
> We'll avoid game-centric tech like Flash, HTMLCanvas frameworks, CSS 3D transforms, WebGL,
> and JavaScript-driven rendering or physics simulation.

This makes our approach relevant to a wide audience.

```jsx
/**
 * Our World component (simplified) written in JSX,
 * i.e. JavaScript with syntactic sugar (the XML tags).
 */
export default function World(props) {

  const update = useUpdate();

  const state = useStateRef(() => { /** ... */ });

  state.gmGraph = useGeomorphs(props.gms);
  state.gmGraph.api = state;

  useHandleEvents(state);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setCached(props.worldKey, state);
    return () => removeCached(props.worldKey);
  }, []);

  return state.gmGraph.ready ? (
    <CssPanZoom onLoad={/** ... */}>
      <Geomorphs api={state} />
      <DebugWorld api={state} />
      <NPCs api={state} onLoad={/** ... */} />
      <FOV api={state} onLoad={/** ... */} />
      <Doors api={state} onLoad={/** ... */} />
    </CssPanZoom>
  ) : null;
}

/** @typedef Props ... */
/** @typedef State ... */

```


### 3. Building the world

To create a game we must _create a world_.
A setting and characters are needed as guiding principles,
although not necessarily as driving forces.

Our setting is _The Last Redoubt_, a gigantic pyramid protecting the last of humanity, as described in [The Night Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land) (1912).
We mention two characters: Andros (the protagonist) and Cartesius (his preceptor);
these names come from [The Night Land, A Story Retold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land#Pastiche,_homages_and_sequels) (2011).
But how to fabricate this pyramid?
How should we build The Last Redoubt?

> Thankfully we've done the groundwork, as shown in the videos below.

<Video videoKey="video--intro-first" />

<aside title="starship-geomorphs">

  The graphics above depict Geomorph 301 (a.k.a. _Bridge_) from Robert Pearce's [Starship Geomorphs 2.0](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-starship-geomorphs-book-if-finally.html).
  We've recreated it using 9 of his [Starship Symbols](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2020/08/starship-symbols-book.html),
  available as PNGs thanks to [Eric Smith](http://ericbsmith.no-ip.org/geomorphs/).
  These wonderful assets provide one of the foundation stones upon which our game is built.

</aside>

It is worth taking the time to make some observations about the above videos.

> **The game has a birdseye viewpoint**.
> Avoiding game-centric tech rules out 3D graphics (except perhaps isometric).

> **The Player moves by navigating the [navmesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh#:~:text=A%20navigation%20mesh%2C%20or%20navmesh,video%20game%20AI%20in%202000.), opening nearby doors**.
> Mouse clicks are converted into world coordinates.
> Doors are styled clickable [divs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDivElement).

> **The Player interacts via mouse clicks or touches**.
> Websites rarely use keyboard controls.

> **The Player is _situated_ with limited visual range**.
> We use two copies of the [same PNG](/assets/geomorph/g-301--bridge.png "@new-tab") (one atop the other).
> The top one is inverted ([CSS filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter)) and masked ([CSS clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)).

The camera ([CSS transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)) further restricts what can be seen, although we can peek by panning and zooming.
These points are illustrated below.

<Carousel
  baseSrc="/assets/pics/intro-carousel/"
  height={450}
  breakpoints={{
    300: {
      slidesPerView: 1,
    },
    450: {
      slidesPerView: 2,
    },
    900: {
      slidesPerView: 3,
    },
  }}
  items={[
    { src: 'birdseye.png', label: 'Birdseye Viewpoint' },
    { src: 'open-nearby-door.png', label: 'Open door via click/touch' },
    { src: 'click-navmesh.png', label: 'Click navmesh to walk' },
    { src: 'enter-door.png', label: 'Entering door changes view'},

    { src: 'open-door-see-more.png', label: 'Open door & see more' },
    { src: 'pan-zoom-see-more.png', label: 'Pan-zoom to peek' },
  ]}
/>

So our approach uses [everyday web dev tech](#2--underlying-tech) as promised.
We'll interact with the real McCoy in the next section.
For those itching to see how it is built, check out [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/tty-world-1-0s9wfl?file=/src/index.js "@new-tab").


### 4. Directing the world

We've made progress towards _building_ a world.
But what about _directing it_?

<aside title="recall-our-motivation">

What do we mean by **directing**?

Recall our motivation: _understanding and improving Game AI_.
Instead of implementing parallel systems,
we'll modify the Player's experience e.g.

- Spawn enemy when Player walks through 3 doors.
- Build tension by showing enemies at fringes of vision.
- Tempt Player to particular area and ambush them.
- Indicate room purpose via ghostly replay.
- Orchestrate enemy search party.

This ongoing fabrication of the player's experience is _directing_.

</aside>

The [videos above](#video--intro-first) show a [_terminal_](https://xtermjs.org/ "@new-tab") (black window with mostly green text).
We can type commands and press enter to run them.
They are parsed using the excellent [mvdan-sh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mvdan-sh),
and then interpreted by our own specially written interpreter.
Collectively they convert POSIX-like commands into JavaScript and execute it.
Then:

<!-- > If Game AI (NPC behaviour) is the interaction between the Director (human-software amalgam) and the Player, -->
> **we can direct by running commands in one or more terminals**.
> These commands may include scripts and long-running processes.


An extended example:

<Carousel
  height={220}
  pagination={{ clickable: true }}
  items={[
    <>
      <p>
        Try clicking <i>interact</i> below.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few lines, you'll see repetitions <b>polling for cached query</b>{' '}
        (if not, click reset <Icon icon="refresh" small inline />).
        Clicking disable <Icon icon="cross-circle" small inline />,
        you'll see <b>paused session</b> and the <i>interact</i> button returns.
      </p>
    </>
    ,
    <p>
      Press <i>interact</i> again, and this time click on the 2nd tab.
      You'll see the world from the videos, we suggest you have a play around.
    </p>
    ,
    <p>
      Finally return to the 1st tab and scroll to the top.
    </p>
  ]}
/>

<Tabs
  id="intro-1"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={500}
  tabs={[
    [
      {
          type: 'terminal',
          filepath: 'intro-tty-1',
          env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
      },
      { type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-1' },
    ],
  ]}
  initHorizontal
  // persistLayout
/>

Let's try to understand some of the lines above.

| Line | Info |
| --- | ----------- |
| ℹ️`  Running /home/PROFILE` | The absolute path <InlineCode copy>/home/PROFILE</InlineCode> refers to a string (the terminal's initialisation script). Try typing it into the terminal, or click and paste (easier on a mobile). |
| `source /etc/util-1` | The 1st line of the string at `/home/PROFILE`. This command executes the string at <InlineCode copy>/etc/util-1</InlineCode> which defines util functions. |
| `source /etc/game-1` | From `/home/PROFILE`, <InlineCode copy>/etc/game-1</InlineCode> defines game-related functions. List all functions via <InlineCode copy>declare</InlineCode>. Those with a dev console can <InlineCode copy>declare \| log</InlineCode>. |
| `awaitWorld` | From `/home/PROFILE`, this command awaits a world whose identifier is the string at <InlineCode copy>/home/WORLD_KEY</InlineCode>. While polling it sends lines, as we saw. |

  What about the rest of `/home/PROFILE`?

  It spawns Andros, sets him as the Player,
  and finally initiates 3 long-running background processes.
  That is,
  (a) the camera tracks Andros,
  (b) clicking the navmesh makes him walk,
  (c) clicking outside the navmesh makes him turn.

<aside title="js-shell">

  Our [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)#Command-line_shells) wraps JavaScript in a Command Line Interface.
  The central entities in JavaScript are **values** (primitive or object) rather than files.
  Each terminal has an associated root object where
  e.g. `root.home.PROFILE` is a string defining the initialisation script.

</aside>

We've recorded the above example on desktop and mobile.

### 5. Finished product

Game developers are prone to a particular disease.
They try to make a game but create a _game engine_ instead.
Years of effort with zero result.
Thankfully, our driving force is _Game AI_ rather than releasing a game.
We'll publish the process step-by-step right here.
It is relevant to a wide audience: web developers and video game enthusiasts.

No one knows how to study Game AI abstractly.
It rarely overlaps with the academic subject _Artificial Intelligence_.
But we shouldn't forget
(a) the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence) was originally a gender-bending party game,
(b) providing believable NPC behaviour is analogous to winning this game.
This doesn't mean we are solving a problem of similar difficulty!
The Turing Test handles _arbitrary_ textual input,
whereas all existing implementations of believable NPC behaviour deal with very specific situations.

Lacking an abstract approach,
we'll embed all our ideas into a single video game.

> So what's our game going to be?

<aside title="game-influences">

Teleglitch (2013) is a strong influence.

> The protagonist must escape a military base (as opposed to protecting it).
Levels are randomly generated by connecting "modules" (like Geomorphs).
The top-down line-of-sight view also provides inspiration.

Fallout 1 &amp; 2 and GTA 1 &amp; 2 are breathtakingly brilliant open-world games from the late 90s.
They'll serve as reference points and sources of inspiration.

</aside>

We expect to continually alternate between exposition and Game AI development.
But we mustn't meander too much or we'll get lost.
Then a level or scenario (part of a level) should be kept in mind.

> **First level outline**.
>
> Andros has just travelled through the first 1000 cities.
> Cartesius encourages him to ordain into the 320 temples of the _Upper Pyramid_.
> Andros and the other Novices begin by learning certain
> hidden knowledge concerning the _Watchers_.
