### About

This blog is all about programming Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
They correspond to the dynamic part of video games,
excluding the Player and simple machines like doors and weapons.
My personal interest began with the ZX Spectrum in the late 1980s.
In those days anything seemed possible.
Nowadays, NPC has even become [an insult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).

We'll try to remain silent concerning the current state of affairs.
Video games have their own metrics of success.
We're going to study NPCs for their own sake.
But what distinguishes our approach?

1. Dedicated to programming NPCs.
1. Browser-based CLI for doing so.
1. CSS-based rendering and interactivity. <SideNote>We intentionally avoid JavaScript [game loops](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/656).</SideNote>

Before things get a bit abstract, here are some screenshots:

<!-- CSS vs HTMLCanvas i.e. in our approach we can use Chrome devtool -->
<!-- Component ~ React Component -->

<aside title="screenshots">

  _A World and a Terminal_ (above) depicts a [`Tabs` component](https://github.com/rob-myers/the-last-redoubt/blob/master/src/components/page/Tabs.tsx#:~:text=function%20Tabs "@new-tab") with five tabs.
  Two of the tabs are visible.
  The left tab is an instance of a [`World` component](https://github.com/rob-myers/the-last-redoubt/blob/master/src/projects/world/World.jsx#:~:text=export%20default-,function%20World,-(props) "@new-tab") and
  the right tab instantiates a [`Terminal` component](https://github.com/rob-myers/the-last-redoubt/blob/master/src/components/sh/Terminal.tsx#:~:text=function%20Terminal "@new-tab").
  The `World` shows an NPC from a birdseye perspective.
  The commands in the `Terminal` indicate this is "andros" and he is actually the Player.
  The other images show the `Tabs`, `World` and `Terminal` in other states.

üöß Illustrate CLI via Video and explain

<Carousel
  height={500}
  items={[
    { video: 'cli-demo-1' },
  ]}
/>

üöß Illustrate CSS via GIF?

üöß Please [read the introduction](/intro/). Initially we need a fair amount of exposition.
This reflects our initial work on the "game engine" before we started creating this site.
Partial exposition is indicated by <RoadWorksIcon bottom />.


### Demo

üöß Actions speak louder than words.
Click to navigate or interact (e.g. open doors).
You can drag/scroll/pinch to pan and zoom.
Try resetting (<Icon icon="refresh" small inline />), maximising a tab or all tabs (<Icon icon="expand" small inline />), and disabling (<Icon icon="cross-circle" small inline />).
Show debug circles by typing <InlineCode copy>DEBUG=1; npc config</InlineCode>.

<Tabs
  id="demo-tabs"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  persistLayout
  initHorizontal
  tabs={[
    [
      { type: 'component', filepath: 'world-demo-1' },
    ],
    [
      { type: 'terminal', filepath: 'demo-1@test', env: { WORLD_KEY: 'world-demo-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() } },
    ],
  ]}
/>
