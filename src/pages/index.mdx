### About

This blog is all about programming Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
They correspond to the dynamic part of video games,
excluding simple machines like doors and weapons (and the Player themselves).
My personal interest started with the ZX Spectrum in the late 1980s.
In those (relatively) early days anything seemed possible.
Nowadays, NPC has even become [an insult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).

Concerning the current state of affairs, we will remain mostly silent.
Video games have their own metrics of success.
We'll study NPCs for their own sake.
But how?

<!-- Won't it be a bit dry? -->

Please [read the introduction](/intro/).
We're going to build a game step-by-step directly on this blog,
using everyday web technologies.
See the screenshots and demo below.

This site is a mixture of:
- _Engine_: our underlying scriptable Game Engine.
- _Exposition_: writing about Game Dev/AI.
- _Execution_: the Video Game itself.

Initially we need a fair amount of exposition.
This reflects our initial work on the Game Engine before we started creating this site.
Partial exposition is indicated by <RoadWorksIcon bottom />.


### Demo

Actions speak louder than words.
Click to navigate or interact (e.g. open doors).
You can drag/scroll/pinch to pan and zoom.
Try resetting (<Icon icon="refresh" small inline />), maximising a tab or all tabs (<Icon icon="expand" small inline />), and disabling (<Icon icon="cross-circle" small inline />).
Show debug circles by typing <InlineCode copy>DEBUG=1; npc config</InlineCode>.

<Tabs
  id="demo-tabs"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  persistLayout
  initHorizontal
  tabs={[
    [
      { type: 'component', filepath: 'world-demo-1' },
    ],
    [
      { type: 'terminal', filepath: 'demo-1@test', env: { WORLD_KEY: 'world-demo-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() } },
    ],
  ]}
/>
