## Objective

We are going to create a **video game**.
Unusually,
(a) we'll describe the process in detail,
(b) we'll use everyday web development techniques.

What kind of game?
> A [top-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_graphics#Top-down_perspective) adventure.

Where does it take place?
> [The Night Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land "@new-tab") - a futuristic Earth where the Sun has died.
> The last survivors of humanity reside in a gigantic pyramid called _The Last Redoubt_.

<aside>

  Actually, _The Night Land_ (1912) is a book written by [William Hope Hodgson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hope_Hodgson).
  His _Last Redoubt_ consisted of 1,320 cities and the same number of floors.
  On the other hand, we assume these 1000 + 320 cities span 125 + 64 = 189 floors,
  and are constructed from ancient interconnected space vehicles.
  
  Some concept art will clarify things.

How will you make it?
> Using standard web development techniques, emphasizing the declarative nature of HTML and CSS
> rather than JavaScript-driven game-loops.
> We'll avoid game-centric technology like WebGL and physics engines.
> Then our approach is relevant to a wide audience i.e. web developers.

What distinguishes it?
> Aside from standard web dev techniques,
> we'll use a [browser-based terminal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xterm) running our own _interactive shell_.
> We can spawn NPCs, request nav-paths, run initialisation scripts, and execute long-running processes.
> Readers will use this [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) to run demos, inspect internal state, and implement their own behaviours.
