## Introduction

> __What's this website about?__
>
> Game AI.

By _game_ we mean [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game),
whereas _AI_ stands for Artificial Intelligence. 
_Game AI_ amounts to a loose collection of algorithms and data structures for controlling [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character).
The all-important Non-Player Characters must move in a realistic manner,
drawing the player into the fabrication, and keeping them hooked.

Game AI tutorials tend towards emergent behaviour.
Given NPCs which can navigate the game world, with their own desires and stratagems,
one can certainly run them in parallel with the Player.
But unfortunately a _combinatorial explosion of possibilities_ arises,
inevitably resulting in unrealistic and unpredictable behaviour.

Focusing on what the Player actually experiences yields a far more successful approach.
There's the Player and the _Environment_, the latter controlled by the _Director_.
A simulated world of NPCs is only needed inasmuch as the Player notices it.
This is definitely the way to go.
However, it means we'll need to _create a game_ in order to make meaningful Game AI.

> Thankfully, we've done the groundwork already.

<!-- TODO intro Tabs below -->

<Tabs
  id="intro-1"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-1' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-1',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>

Now, video games are a _lot of work_.
There's the story, characters, graphical style, user interface, assets, animation, level design, scripting and NPC behaviour.
Many systems must be created, collectively forming a cohesive whole.
One popular approach takes inspiration from films.
That is, the _story_ and _characters_ (including the player) sit on the podium, and the other systems bring them to life.

> To put Game AI on the podium, we've chosen a different role model:
>
> Web Development.

Web Development is a particular kind of Software Development.
It uses special purpose languages i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We'll develop our game using the _everyday practices_ of a Web Developer.
This rules out game-centric technologies like Flash, Game Frameworks, CSS 3D transforms, and WebGL.
But it also makes our approach relevant to a wide audience.

<!-- TODO not just using Web as a platform; we're using it as a dev env too -->

Concerning the game systems, we've done the groundwork already.
This is just as well, else our investigation of Game AI would be on the distant horizon.
Consider the component below:

<Tabs
  id="intro-2"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-2' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-2',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-2', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>


- What do we mean?
- This doesn't mean the story and characters are unimportant.
- But when _Game AI_ plays second fiddle to _Story_ ...
- We do not mean "use the Web as a platform"
- We do not mean "Web Games" like Flash, WebGL etc.
- Story and Characters still sit on podium
