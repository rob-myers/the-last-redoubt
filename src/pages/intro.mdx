## Introduction

> Game AI.
>
> That's what this website is about.

By _Game_ we mean [Video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game).
By _AI_ we mean Artificial Intelligence. 
Putting these words together, _Game AI_ is a loose collection of algorithms, interfaces and data structures for controlling [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character).
It derives much of its meaning from its context, and is not an academic subject.
Then to develop meaningful Game AI we'll need to create a game.

Now, video games are a _lot of work_.
There's the story, characters, graphical style, user interface, assets, animation, level design, scripting and NPC behaviour.
Many systems must be created, collectively forming a cohesive whole.
One popular approach takes inspiration from films.
That is, the _story_ and _characters_ (including the player) sit on the podium, and the other systems bring them to life.

> To put Game AI on the podium, we've chosen a different role model:
>
> Web Development.

Web Development is a particular kind of Software Development.
It uses special purpose languages i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We'll develop our game using the _everyday practices_ of a Web Developer.
This rules out game-centric technologies like Flash, Game Frameworks, CSS 3D transforms, and WebGL.
But it also makes our approach relevant to a wide audience.

<!-- TODO not just using Web as a platform; we're using it as a dev env too -->

Concerning the game systems, we've done the groundwork already.
This is just as well, else our investigation of Game AI would be on the distant horizon.
Consider the component below:

<Tabs
  id="intro-1"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [
      { type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-1' },
      { type: 'code', filepath: 'world/World.jsx' },
      { type: 'code', filepath: 'world/NPCs.jsx' },
    ],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-1',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>


- What do we mean?
- This doesn't mean the story and characters are unimportant.
- But when _Game AI_ plays second fiddle to _Story_ ...
- We do not mean "use the Web as a platform"
- We do not mean "Web Games" like Flash, WebGL etc.
- Story and Characters still sit on podium


<!-- TODO alignment with web dev -->

<!-- TODO bring Tabs into this early -->
