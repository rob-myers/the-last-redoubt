## Introduction

What's this website about?

> Game AI.

By _game_ we mean [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game)
whereas _AI_ stands for Artificial Intelligence. 
_Game AI_ amounts to a loose collection of algorithms and data structures for controlling [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character).
These all-important Non-Player Characters must behave realistically,
steadily drawing the Player into the fabrication.

Reading Game AI tutorials, one can get the impression that intelligent behaviour will _emerge_ from the right ingredients.
Given NPCs with their own desires and strategies, we can certainly run them in parallel with the Player.
But for anything beyond [Koopa Troopas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koopa_Troopa) or [Boo Diddleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_(character)), the result is a mess.
The _combinatorial explosion of possibilities_ inevitably yields
unrealistic and unpredictable behaviour.

Focusing on what the Player actually experiences is a better idea.
There's the Player and there's the _environment_, controlled by a highly opinionated _Director_ (an amalgam of people and software).
The Director and Player interact via the environment.
The Director controls it and the Player has certain degrees of freedom within it.
But the Director needs something to direct,
so we must **create a game** to make meaningful Game AI.

> Thankfully we've done the groundwork,

  The above videos involve **Geomorph 301** (a.k.a. _Bridge_) from Robert Pearce's [Starship Geomorphs 2.0](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-starship-geomorphs-book-if-finally.html).
  Actually, we've recreated it using 9 of his [Starship Symbols](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2020/08/starship-symbols-book.html).

Then our game has a Birdseye viewpoint.
The Player moves by navigating the navmesh and opening nearby doors.
The Player is _situated_, with visual awareness limited by their position.
They can also peek further afield by panning and zooming.
Importantly the video shows some kind of terminal.
Before diving into that, let's summarise with some slides.

<ImageCarousel
  id="intro-video-frames"
  width={300}
  height={550}
  baseSrc="/pics/intro-carousel/"
  items={[
    { src: 'birdseye.png', label: 'Birdseye Viewpoint' },
    { src: 'open-nearby-door.png', label: 'Open door via click/touch' },
    { src: 'click-navmesh.png', label: 'Click navmesh to walk' },
    { src: 'enter-door.png', label: 'Entering door changes view'},
    { src: 'can-go-round-corners.png', label: 'Navigate around corners' },
    { src: 'open-door-see-more.png', label: 'Open door to see more' },
    { src: 'pan-zoom-see-more.png', label: 'Pan-zoom to peek' },
  ]}
  imgStyles={{ marginTop: '-24px', height: 'calc(100% + 24px)' }}  // Crop
  labelTop="10%"
/>

<!-- TODO intro Tabs below -->

But what about the terminal? __TODO__

<Tabs
  id="intro-1"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-1' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-1',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
  initHorizontal={true}
/>

Now, video games are a _lot of work_.
There's the story, characters, graphical style, user interface, assets, animation, level design, scripting and NPC behaviour.
Many systems must be created, collectively forming a cohesive whole.
One popular approach takes inspiration from films.
That is, the _story_ and _characters_ (including the player) sit on the podium, and the other systems bring them to life.

> To put Game AI on the podium, we've chosen a different role model:
>
> Web Development.

Web Development is a particular kind of Software Development.
It uses special purpose languages i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We'll develop our game using the _everyday practices_ of a Web Developer.
This rules out game-centric technologies like Flash, Game Frameworks, CSS 3D transforms, and WebGL.
But it also makes our approach relevant to a wide audience.

<!-- TODO not just using Web as a platform; we're using it as a dev env too -->

Concerning the game systems, we've done the groundwork already.
This is just as well, else our investigation of Game AI would be on the distant horizon.
Consider the component below:

<Tabs
  id="intro-2"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-2' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-2',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-2', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>


- What do we mean?
- This doesn't mean the story and characters are unimportant.
- But when _Game AI_ plays second fiddle to _Story_ ...
- We do not mean "use the Web as a platform"
- We do not mean "Web Games" like Flash, WebGL etc.
- Story and Characters still sit on podium


<!-- TODO alignment with web dev -->
