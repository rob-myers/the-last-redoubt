## Introduction

> __What's this website about?__
>
> Game AI.

By _game_ we mean [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game),
whereas _AI_ stands for Artificial Intelligence. 
_Game AI_ amounts to a loose collection of algorithms and data structures for controlling [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character).
Our all-important Non-Player Characters must move realistically,
steadily drawing the Player into the fabrication.

Game AI tutorials give the impression that intelligent behaviour simply _emerges_ from the right ingredients.
Given NPCs with their own desires and stratagems, we can certainly run them in parallel with the Player.
However, the result is almost always a mess.
The _combinatorial explosion of possibilities_ inevitably gives rise to
unrealistic and unpredictable behaviour.

Focusing on what the Player actually experiences is a better idea.
There's the Player and the _environment_, controlled by a highly opinionated _Director_ (an amalgam of people and software).
Instead of simulating NPCs for the Player to freely interact with,
the Director intentionally interacts with the Player through the environment.
A persistent underlying world is still necessary, but only inasmuch as the Player notices.
This approach requires we **create a game** to make meaningful Game AI.

> Thankfully, we've done the groundwork already.

Let's start with some videos.
They illustrate the graphical assets, level design, character/camera animation, and in-game UI.

<!-- TODO mp4s: desktop âœ…, mobile ðŸš§ -->
<video controls loop height="600">
  <source
    src="/videos/first-video-desktop.mov.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
   />
   Apologies, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

<!-- TODO intro Tabs below -->

<Tabs
  id="intro-1"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-1' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-1',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>

Now, video games are a _lot of work_.
There's the story, characters, graphical style, user interface, assets, animation, level design, scripting and NPC behaviour.
Many systems must be created, collectively forming a cohesive whole.
One popular approach takes inspiration from films.
That is, the _story_ and _characters_ (including the player) sit on the podium, and the other systems bring them to life.

> To put Game AI on the podium, we've chosen a different role model:
>
> Web Development.

Web Development is a particular kind of Software Development.
It uses special purpose languages i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We'll develop our game using the _everyday practices_ of a Web Developer.
This rules out game-centric technologies like Flash, Game Frameworks, CSS 3D transforms, and WebGL.
But it also makes our approach relevant to a wide audience.

<!-- TODO not just using Web as a platform; we're using it as a dev env too -->

Concerning the game systems, we've done the groundwork already.
This is just as well, else our investigation of Game AI would be on the distant horizon.
Consider the component below:

<Tabs
  id="intro-2"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-2' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-2',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-2', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>


- What do we mean?
- This doesn't mean the story and characters are unimportant.
- But when _Game AI_ plays second fiddle to _Story_ ...
- We do not mean "use the Web as a platform"
- We do not mean "Web Games" like Flash, WebGL etc.
- Story and Characters still sit on podium


<!-- TODO alignment with web dev -->
