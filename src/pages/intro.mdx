## Introduction

> Game AI.
>
> That's what this website is about.

_Game_ refers to [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) and _AI_ stands for Artificial Intelligence. 
Putting these words together, _Game AI_ is a loose collection of algorithms, techniques and data structures for controlling [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character).
It does not stand on its own as an academic subject.
Then to discuss and develop Game AI we'll need to create a game.

Now, video games are a _lot of work_.
There's the story, characters, graphical style, user interface, graphical assets, animation, level design, scripting and NPC behaviour.
Many systems must be created, collectively forming a cohesive whole.
Concerning cohesion, games are often presented like films.
The _story_ and _characters_ sit on the podium, while everything else brings the stars of the show to life.

> But for Game AI to sit on the podium, we'll need a different role model:
>
> Web Development.
