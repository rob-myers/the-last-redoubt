## Introduction

What's this website about?

> Game AI.

By _game_ we mean [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game)
whereas _AI_ stands for Artificial Intelligence. 
_Game AI_ amounts to a loose collection of algorithms and data structures for controlling [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character).
These all-important Non-Player Characters must behave realistically,
steadily drawing the Player into the fabrication.

Game AI tutorials give the impression that intelligent behaviour _emerges_ from the right ingredients.
Given NPCs with their own desires and strategies, we can certainly run them in parallel with the Player.
However, for anything beyond a [Koopa Troopa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koopa_Troopa) the result is almost always a mess.
The _combinatorial explosion of possibilities_ inevitably yields
unrealistic and unpredictable behaviour.

Focusing on what the Player actually experiences is a better idea.
There's the Player and there's the _environment_, controlled by a highly opinionated _Director_ (an amalgam of people and software).
The Director and Player interact via the environment.
The Director controls it and the Player has certain degrees of freedom within it.
But the Director needs something to direct,
so we must **create a game** to make meaningful Game AI.

<!-- TODO use Carousel to label certain things that occur in videos -->

TODO
- extra image open-nearby-door
- wrap below into new component ImageCarousel,
- describe images below.

<Carousel id="intro-video-frames" height={550} width={300}>
  {[
    { src: 'birdseye.png', label: 'Birdseye Viewpoint' },
    { src: 'click-navmesh.png', label: 'Click navmesh to walk' },
    { src: 'enter-door.png', label: 'Enter door to change view'},
    { src: 'can-go-round-corners.png', label: 'Navigate round corners' },
    { src: 'open-door-see-more.png', label: 'Open door & see more' },
    { src: 'pan-zoom-see-more.png', label: 'Pan-zoom to change view' },
  ].map(({ src, label }) =>
    <div style="height:100%; overflow:hidden; position: relative">
      <div style="position: absolute; top: 8%; color: white; line-height: 1; font-size: 32px; font-family: Monaco; font-weight: 300; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); padding: 8px 4px; text-transform: lowercase">
        {label}
      </div>
      <img
        key={src}
        src={`/pics/intro-carousel/${src}`}
        style="height:calc(100% + 32px); margin-top: -32px"
      />
    </div>
  )}
</Carousel>

<!-- TODO intro Tabs below -->

<Tabs
  id="intro-1"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-1' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-1',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-1', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>

Now, video games are a _lot of work_.
There's the story, characters, graphical style, user interface, assets, animation, level design, scripting and NPC behaviour.
Many systems must be created, collectively forming a cohesive whole.
One popular approach takes inspiration from films.
That is, the _story_ and _characters_ (including the player) sit on the podium, and the other systems bring them to life.

> To put Game AI on the podium, we've chosen a different role model:
>
> Web Development.

Web Development is a particular kind of Software Development.
It uses special purpose languages i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We'll develop our game using the _everyday practices_ of a Web Developer.
This rules out game-centric technologies like Flash, Game Frameworks, CSS 3D transforms, and WebGL.
But it also makes our approach relevant to a wide audience.

<!-- TODO not just using Web as a platform; we're using it as a dev env too -->

Concerning the game systems, we've done the groundwork already.
This is just as well, else our investigation of Game AI would be on the distant horizon.
Consider the component below:

<Tabs
  id="intro-2"
  initEnabled={false}
  height={600}
  tabs={[
    [{ type: 'component', filepath: 'intro-world-2' }],
    [{
        type: 'terminal',
        filepath: 'intro-tty-2',
        env: { WORLD_KEY: 'intro-world-2', PROFILE: profileLookup['profile-1-a']() },
    }],
  ]}
/>


- What do we mean?
- This doesn't mean the story and characters are unimportant.
- But when _Game AI_ plays second fiddle to _Story_ ...
- We do not mean "use the Web as a platform"
- We do not mean "Web Games" like Flash, WebGL etc.
- Story and Characters still sit on podium
