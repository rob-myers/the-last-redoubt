## Objective

We are going to create a **video game**.
Unusually,
(a) we'll describe the process in detail,
(b) we'll use everyday web development techniques.

What kind of game?
> A [top-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_graphics#Top-down_perspective) adventure game.

Where does it take place?
> [The Night Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land "@new-tab") - a futuristic Earth whose Sun has died.
> Humanity resides in a gigantic pyramid called _The Last Redoubt_.

<aside>

  _The Night Land_ (1912) was written by [William Hope Hodgson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hope_Hodgson).
  His _Last Redoubt_ had 1,320 cities and the same number of floors.
  We instead assume these 1000 + 320 cities span 125 + 64 = 189 floors, and are built from ancient interconnected space vehicles.
  
  Some concept art will clarify things.

</aside>

<!-- TODO replace <div> by <Tabs> -->

<div
  class="tabs"
  name="redoubt-sketch"
  height="[400, 580]"
  enabled="true"
  tabs="[
    { type: 'component', filepath: 'example/Images#redoubt-sketches' },
  ]"
/>

OK, but how will you make the game?
> Using standard web dev techniques, emphasizing the declarative nature of HTML and CSS
> rather than JavaScript driven game-loops.
> We shall avoid game-centric technology like WebGL and physics engines.
> Then our approach is relevant to a wide audience i.e. web developers.

What distinguishes it?
> We'll build an adventure game on this website, step by step, blog by blog.
> We've already mentioned we'll use standard web development techniques.
> Additionally, we'll use a [browser-based terminal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xterm), running our own _interactive shell_.
> We'll use it to spawn NPCs, request nav-paths, run scripts, and execute long-running processes.
> You can also use this CLI to run the demos, inspect internal state, and implement your own behaviours.
