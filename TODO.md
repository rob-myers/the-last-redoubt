  - ✅ better Tabs props
  - ✅ can have multiple World tabs `${worldKey}`  
  - ✅ avoid sessionKeys like `test` -- global over site
  - ✅ disable Tabs when outside viewport for 1 second
  - ✅ use a 'code' Tab
  - ✅ Better way to generate World components
  - Make some GIFs explaining how to use `<Tabs/>`
  - Render something with graphviz extension
  - Some graphs between early paragraphs
  - 🚧 Remove codemirror
    - Find replacement first
    - Can highlight CSS-in-JS separately if possible

- CodeSandbox
  - 🚧 with new terminal
  - terminal + World
- StackBlitz too

- Can see on GitHub Comments site

## Screen captures

✅ Convert a screen recording to MP4 or GIF

- ```sh
  # Convert mov to mp4
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -qscale 0 output.mp4
  # Convert mov to gif
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -qscale 0 output.gif
  ```
- file:///Users/robmyers/coding/the-last-redoubt/public/output.gif

✅ Smaller + Faster GIF

- https://www.baeldung.com/linux/convert-videos-gifs-ffmpeg#creating-a-custom-palette
- ```sh
  # 20 seconds (orig 19s), output 4.3mb
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=720:-1" output.gif
  # 1.3Mb
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=400:-1" output.gif
  # 1.1Mb
  ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=300:-1" output.gif
  ```
- file:///Users/robmyers/coding/the-last-redoubt/public/output.gif

- too large

- ❌ CSS GIF pause-reset/play https://css-tricks.com/pause-gif-details-summary/

✅ Try MP4 and WebM

```sh
# 210kb
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=400:-1" output.mp4
# 300kb
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/first-attempt.mov -t 20 -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10,scale=400:-1" output.webm
```

## Future

- BUG CssPanZoom zoom out which pointer down and drag around
- ✅ Always show navpath (no need for DEBUG=true)
- ❌ CodeMirror highlighting for JSDoc types?
- Fix eslint warns
- Start using `_` i.e. last value shortcut
- Nav should weight closed doors
- Fix HMR of NPC (walks without going anywhere)
- Spawn should trigger a player collision test
- modularise npc JSON
- Avoid overwrite e.g. public/geomorph via pages/geomorph.mdx
- Saw `World` fail silently due to use-geomorph-data bug
- anchor/action link sends user back to Tabs, displaying text in session
  - perhaps text added to "queue", and opens respective `Terminal`?

## Done

- ✅ Better fix for non-maximised Terminal on Mobile
  - ✅ https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/
  - ✅ https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options
- Fix xterm links on mobile (Chrome Android)
- ✅ BUG non-maximised Terminal on Mobile
  - ⛔️ xterm fit addon has an issue
    - avoid tall TouchHelperUI
    - `xterm.paste('')` redraws correctly
- ✅ BUG multiple tabs: enable one seems to initially mount all
- ✅ BUG terminals not getting disabled after Tabs reset
- ✅ BUG with multiple world click handling?
  - try simplifying PROFILE
  - occurs with both`goLoop andros &`, and both `lookLoop andros &`
  - problem was name-collision in `/dev`
- ✅ Migrate projects/world
- ✅ Show in test.mdx
- ✅ Migrate to React 18

- ✅ Get profile-1-a working
  - Fix initial lit issue
  - Fix persistent PROFILE issue

- ✅ When tab initially maximised, unseen tabs should not be rendered

- If Tabs initially disabled:
  - ✅ World won't request unseen geomorphs
  - ✅ Terminal initially lacks session

- ✅ profile pastes into tty
- ✅ profile paste suppresses prompt and history
- ✅ 'await-prompt' does not block 'line' commands
- ❌ non-bg source also pastes into tty
- ✅ 'await-prompt' does not block 'resolve' commands
- ✅ avoid persisting PROFILE

- ✅ create-npc now State of `<NPC>`
  - consequently, hot-reloadable

- ✅ Fix reload Tabs error:
  - NPCs.jsx:277 Uncaught (in promise) Error: npc "andros" does not exist
  - Concerns  {npcKey: 'andros', action: 'cancel'}

- ✅ on reload Tabs ensure store.tabs.enabled `true`

- ✅ Can reset while profile running, without tty errors
  - ✅ cancel pending pastes
  - ✅ cleanup session xterm
    - ✅ cancel ongoing commands
    - ✅ unlink tty

- ✅ Disable/Enable Tabs should not make idle npc walk again

- ✅ `ready` -> `awaitWorld`
- ✅ Initial panzoom error (cancelled) should not propagate 
- ✅ Avoid full refresh on change `World`
  - ISSUE with getter inside `useStateRef` i.e. `state` was undefined
- ✅ `spawn` should not finish until npc mounted and NPCS.npc[key] exists

- ✅ `spawn foo $( click 1 )` should not trigger a walk
  - seems `goLoop` is receiving click before npc has moved, so plans a walk
  - we force click to be ignored by earlier handlers

- ✅ fix stateroom 100 (as seen in gm 303)

- ✅ stop npc from walking through doors
  ```sh
  nav foo $( click 1 ) | walk foo
  ```
- ✅ rethink light through nearby doors
- ✅ Weird animation pause on disable Tabs
- ✅ Change Tabs splitter size on mobile
  ```tsx
  (jsonModel.global = jsonModel.global || {}).splitterSize = 16;
  (jsonModel.global = jsonModel.global || {}).splitterExtra = 12;
  ```
