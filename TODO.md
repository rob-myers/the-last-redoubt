# TODO

- 🚧 Start new page intro.mdx
  - it will replace objective.mdx
  - ✅ better Tabs props
  - ✅ can have multiple World tabs `${worldKey}`  
  - ✅ avoid sessionKeys like `test` -- global over site
  - ✅ disable Tabs when outside viewport for 1 second
  - 

- CodeSandbox
  - 🚧 with new terminal
  - terminal + World
- StackBlitz too

- Can see on GitHub Comments site

- ✅ Always show navpath (no need for DEBUG=true)
- Start using `_` i.e. last value shortcut
- Nav should weight closed doors
- Fix HMR of NPC (walks without going anywhere)
- Spawn should trigger a player collision test
- modularise npc JSON
- Avoid overwrite e.g. public/geomorph via pages/geomorph.mdx
- Saw `World` fail silently due to use-geomorph-data bug
- anchor/action link sends user back to Tabs, displaying text in session
  - perhaps text added to "queue", and opens respective `Terminal`?

- ✅ BUG terminals not getting disabled after Tabs reset
- ✅ BUG with multiple world click handling?
  - try simplifying PROFILE
  - occurs with both`goLoop andros &`, and both `lookLoop andros &`
  - problem was name-collision in `/dev`
- ✅ Migrate projects/world
- ✅ Show in test.mdx
- ✅ Migrate to React 18

- ✅ Get profile-1-a working
  - Fix initial lit issue
  - Fix persistent PROFILE issue

- ✅ When tab initially maximised, unseen tabs should not be rendered

- If Tabs initially disabled:
  - ✅ World won't request unseen geomorphs
  - ✅ Terminal initially lacks session

- ✅ profile pastes into tty
- ✅ profile paste suppresses prompt and history
- ✅ 'await-prompt' does not block 'line' commands
- ❌ non-bg source also pastes into tty
- ✅ 'await-prompt' does not block 'resolve' commands
- ✅ avoid persisting PROFILE

- ✅ create-npc now State of `<NPC>`
  - consequently, hot-reloadable

- ✅ Fix reload Tabs error:
  - NPCs.jsx:277 Uncaught (in promise) Error: npc "andros" does not exist
  - Concerns  {npcKey: 'andros', action: 'cancel'}

- ✅ on reload Tabs ensure store.tabs.enabled `true`

- ✅ Can reset while profile running, without tty errors
  - ✅ cancel pending pastes
  - ✅ cleanup session xterm
    - ✅ cancel ongoing commands
    - ✅ unlink tty

- ✅ Disable/Enable Tabs should not make idle npc walk again

- ✅ `ready` -> `awaitWorld`
- ✅ Initial panzoom error (cancelled) should not propagate 
- ✅ Avoid full refresh on change `World`
  - ISSUE with getter inside `useStateRef` i.e. `state` was undefined
- ✅ `spawn` should not finish until npc mounted and NPCS.npc[key] exists

- ✅ `spawn foo $( click 1 )` should not trigger a walk
  - seems `goLoop` is receiving click before npc has moved, so plans a walk
  - we force click to be ignored by earlier handlers

- ✅ fix stateroom 100 (as seen in gm 303)

- ✅ stop npc from walking through doors
  ```sh
  nav foo $( click 1 ) | walk foo
  ```
- ✅ rethink light through nearby doors
- ✅ Weird animation pause on disable Tabs
- ✅ Change Tabs splitter size on mobile
  ```tsx
  (jsonModel.global = jsonModel.global || {}).splitterSize = 16;
  (jsonModel.global = jsonModel.global || {}).splitterExtra = 12;
  ```
